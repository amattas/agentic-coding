Develop working exploits based on vulnerability analysis.

## Inputs
- `context/binary-info.md` - Target info
- `context/vulnerability-analysis.md` - Identified vulns
- `context/gadgets.md` - ROP gadgets (if needed)
- `examples/` - Reference exploits (if available, match style)

## Development Process

1. **Review analysis**
   - Confirm vulnerability and trigger conditions
   - Note required addresses and offsets
   - Identify payload constraints (bad chars, length)

2. **Exploit structure**
   - Follow `examples/` style if available
   - Linear code flow, minimal functions
   - Clear variable naming

3. **Payload construction**
   - Calculate offsets precisely
   - Handle stack alignment (16-byte for x64)
   - Account for bad characters

4. **Testing**
   - Test locally first with debugging
   - Verify each stage works
   - Adapt for remote differences

## Code Style

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

context.arch = 'amd64'

EXECUTABLE = "./target"
ENV = {}

# Local
p = process([EXECUTABLE], env=ENV)
#gdb.attach(p, gdbscript="b *main")

# Remote
#p = remote("host", PORT)

elf = ELF(EXECUTABLE)

# [Exploit code here - linear, simple]

p.interactive()
```

## Output

Create `exploit.py` that:
- Matches examples/ style (if available)
- Works locally
- Has commented remote connection
- Includes debug print statements
- Successfully retrieves flag

Create `find.py` if address discovery is needed separately.
Update `STATUS.md` with progress.
