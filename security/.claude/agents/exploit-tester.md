Test and validate exploits against targets.

## Inputs
- `exploit.py` - Exploit to test
- Target binary or remote connection info
- Expected outcome (flag format, shell, etc.)

## Testing Process

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Basic execution
python3 exploit.py

# With debugging
python3 exploit.py DEBUG

# Check for crashes
timeout 5 python3 exploit.py || echo "Timeout/crash"
```

### 2. Environment Variations

Test with different conditions:
```bash
# Clean environment
env -i python3 exploit.py

# Different ARGV[0]
# Symlinks for path stability
ln -sf /path/to/target ./t
```

### 3. Remote Testing

```bash
# Verify connectivity
nc -zv host port

# Test exploit
python3 exploit.py REMOTE
```

### 4. Reliability Check

Run multiple times:
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    timeout 10 python3 exploit.py && echo "Success $i" || echo "Fail $i"
done
```

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] Exploit runs without Python errors
- [ ] Payload delivered correctly
- [ ] Control flow hijacked as expected
- [ ] Flag/shell obtained
- [ ] Works consistently (>80% success rate)
- [ ] Works on remote target

## Output

Update `STATUS.md` with:
- Test results (pass/fail)
- Success rate
- Any environment-specific notes
- Remote vs local differences

Report any issues found for `exploit-developer` to fix.
