# Code Review

Systematically review code changes for quality, consistency, and potential issues.

## Review Areas

1. **Style**: Naming, formatting, idioms
2. **Performance**: Efficiency, complexity
3. **Maintainability**: Readability, duplication
4. **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases

## Output

- `templates/review-style.md` for style issues
- `templates/review-performance.md` for performance issues

## Tips

- Focus on significant issues, not nitpicks
- Explain why something is problematic
- Suggest specific improvements
- Acknowledge good patterns too
- Prioritize by impact
