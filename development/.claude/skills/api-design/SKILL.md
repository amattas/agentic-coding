# API Design

Define the interface contracts for APIs, including endpoints, request/response schemas, and error handling.

## Process

1. Review spec.md and architecture.md
2. Define endpoints and HTTP methods
3. Design request and response schemas
4. Define error responses and codes
5. Consider versioning strategy

## Output

Create `api-design.md` using the template in `templates/api-design.md`.

## Tips

- Use consistent naming conventions
- Design for backwards compatibility
- Include example payloads
- Document rate limits if applicable
- Consider pagination for list endpoints
